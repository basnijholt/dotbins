# Getting Started

This guide will help you install and start using dotbins in minutes.

## Installation

<!-- CODE:START -->
<!-- print(include_section("../README.md", "installation", strip_heading=True)) -->

We highly recommend to use [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to install/run `dotbins`:

```bash
uvx dotbins
```

or install as a global command:

```bash
uv tool install dotbins
```

Otherwise, simply use pip:

```bash
pip install dotbins
```

You'll also need to create or update your `dotbins.yaml` configuration file either in the same directory as the script or at a custom location specified with `--tools-dir`.

Using the amazing [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager (`uv tool install dotbins`):

```bash
# Create a sample configuration file to get started
dotbins init

# Install/update tools using a config file (to tools_dir, e.g., ~/.dotbins)
dotbins sync

# Install a single tool (defaults to ~/.local/bin) - No config needed!
dotbins get junegunn/fzf

# Install tools from a remote config (defaults to ~/.local/bin)
dotbins get https://github.com/basnijholt/.dotbins/blob/main/dotbins.yaml
```
