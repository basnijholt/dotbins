**dotbins** manages CLI tool binaries in your [dotfiles](https://github.com/basnijholt/dotfiles) repository, offering:

- ✅ Cross-platform binary management (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- ✅ No admin privileges required
- ✅ Version-controlled CLI tools
- ✅ Downloads from GitHub releases
- ✅ Perfect for dotfiles synchronization

No package manager, no sudo, no problem.

See this example `.dotbins` repository: [basnijholt/.dotbins](https://github.com/basnijholt/.dotbins) completely managed with `dotbins`.

> [!NOTE]
> 💡 **What makes dotbins different?** Unlike similar tools, dotbins uniquely integrates tool-specific shell configurations
> (aliases, completions, etc.) directly in your dotfiles workflow, not just binary downloads, and allows a Git workflow for managing binaries.

## Why I Created dotbins

I frequently works across multiple environments where I clone [my dotfiles repository](https://github.com/basnijholt/dotfiles) with all my preferred configurations.
I faced a common frustration: some of my favorite tools (`fzf`, `bat`, `zoxide`, etc.) were not available on the new system and installing them with a package manager is too much work or even not possible.
`dotbins` was born out of this frustration.

It allows me to:

1. Track pre-compiled binaries in a [separate Git repository](https://github.com/basnijholt/.dotbins) (using Git LFS for efficient storage)
2. Include that repository as a submodule in my dotfiles
3. Ensure all my essential tools are _immediately_ available after cloning, regardless of system permissions

Now when I clone [my dotfiles](https://github.com/basnijholt/dotfiles) on any new system, I get not just my configurations but also all the CLI tools I depend on for productivity, **ready to use with their specific aliases and shell initializations automatically configured**.

**_No package manager, no sudo, no problem!_**

`dotbins` fills a specific niche in the binary management ecosystem. Here's how it compares to key alternatives:

| Tool          | Version Management                 | Shell Integration             | Dotfiles Integration           | Primary Use Case           |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| **dotbins**   | Latest only                        | **Built-in via `shell_code`** | **First-class with Git (LFS)** | Complete dotfiles solution |
| **binenv**    | Multiple versions with constraints | Separate completion scripts   | Not focused on                 | Development environments   |
| **eget**      | Latest or specific only            | None                          | Not focused on                 | Quick one-off installs     |
| **asdf/aqua** | Multiple plugins & versions        | Plugin-specific               | Not focused on                 | Development environments   |
| **apt/brew**  | System packages                    | None                          | Not possible                   | System-wide management     |

### Key Alternatives

#### Version Managers (e.g., `binenv`, `asdf`)

- **Pros:** Advanced version management (constraints like `>=1.2.3`), multiple versions side-by-side
- **Cons vs. `dotbins`:**
  - Focus on version management rather than dotfiles integration
  - **Separate configuration needed for shell integration** (aliases, completions)
  - Often use shims or more complex architecture
- **When to choose:** For development environments where you need multiple versions of tools

#### Binary Downloaders (e.g., `eget`)

- **Pros:** Lightweight, fast for one-off downloads
- **Cons vs. `dotbins`:**
  - No configuration for multiple tools
  - **No shell integration** for aliases or environment setup
  - No version tracking between sessions
- **When to choose:** For quick installation of individual tools without configuration needs

#### System Package Managers (`apt`, `brew`, etc.)

- **Pros:** System-wide installation, dependency management
- **Cons vs. `dotbins`:**
  - Require admin privileges
  - Not portable across systems
  - Cannot be version-controlled in dotfiles
- **When to choose:** For system-wide software needed by multiple users

### The `dotbins` Difference

`dotbins` uniquely combines:

1. **Binary management** - Downloading from GitHub Releases
2. **Shell configuration** - Defining aliases and shell setup in the same file:
   ```yaml
   bat:
     repo: sharkdp/bat
     shell_code: |
       alias cat="bat --plain --paging=never"
   ```
3. **Dotfiles integration** - Designed to be version-controlled as a Git repository
4. **Cross-platform portability** - Works the same across Linux, macOS, Windows

This makes it perfect for users who want to manage their complete shell environment in a version-controlled dotfiles repository that can be easily deployed on any system.
