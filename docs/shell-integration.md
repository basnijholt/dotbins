dotbins creates shell scripts that add binaries to your `PATH` and apply your custom tool configurations.

After running `dotbins sync` or `dotbins init`, shell integration scripts are created in `~/.dotbins/shell/` for various shells (Bash, Zsh, Fish, Nushell, and PowerShell)

### What's in the Shell Scripts?

The generated shell scripts do two main things:

1. **Add binaries to PATH** - Makes tool binaries available for your platform/architecture
2. **Apply your tool-specific shell_code** - Sets up aliases, completions, and initializations

For example, with this configuration:

```yaml
fzf:
  repo: junegunn/fzf
  shell_code: |
    source <(fzf --zsh)

bat:
  repo: sharkdp/bat
  shell_code: |
    alias bat="bat --paging=never"
    alias cat="bat --plain --paging=never"
```

The generated `zsh.sh` will include:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env zsh
# dotbins - Add platform-specific binaries to PATH
_os=$(uname -s | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')
[[ "$_os" == "darwin" ]] && _os="macos"

_arch=$(uname -m)
[[ "$_arch" == "x86_64" ]] && _arch="amd64"
[[ "$_arch" == "aarch64" || "$_arch" == "arm64" ]] && _arch="arm64"

export PATH="$HOME/.dotbins/$_os/$_arch/bin:$PATH"

# Tool-specific configurations
# Configuration for fzf
if command -v fzf >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    source <(fzf --zsh)
fi

# Configuration for bat
if command -v bat >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    alias bat="bat --paging=never"
    alias cat="bat --plain --paging=never"
fi
```

### Shell Startup Integration

Add this line to your shell's startup file to integrate dotbins:

```bash
# For Zsh (~/.zshrc)
source "$HOME/.dotbins/shell/zsh.sh"

# For Bash (~/.bashrc)
source "$HOME/.dotbins/shell/bash.sh"

# For Fish (~/.config/fish/config.fish)
source "$HOME/.dotbins/shell/fish.fish"

# For Nushell
source ~/.dotbins/shell/nushell.nu
```
