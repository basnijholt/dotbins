**dotbins** manages CLI tool binaries in your dotfiles repository, offering:

- ✅ Cross-platform binary management (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- ✅ No admin privileges required
- ✅ Version-controlled CLI tools
- ✅ Downloads from GitHub releases
- ✅ Perfect for dotfiles synchronization

No package manager, no sudo, no problem.

See this example `.dotbins` repository: [basnijholt/.dotbins](https://github.com/basnijholt/.dotbins) completely managed with `dotbins`.

> [!NOTE]
> 💡 **What makes dotbins different?** Unlike similar tools, dotbins uniquely integrates tool-specific shell configurations
> (aliases, completions, etc.) directly in your dotfiles workflow, not just binary downloads, and allows a Git workflow for managing binaries.

## :zap: Quick Start

Using the amazing [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager (`uv tool install dotbins`):

```bash
# Install directly to ~/.local/bin (no configuration needed)
dotbins get junegunn/fzf

# Set up multiple tools with a config file (creates ~/.dotbins)
dotbins sync

# Bootstrap a collection of tools from a remote config
dotbins get https://github.com/basnijholt/.dotbins/blob/main/dotbins.yaml
```

## :star2: Features

- 🌐 Supports multiple platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows) and architectures (amd64, arm64, etc.)
- 📦 Downloads and organizes binaries from GitHub releases
- 🔄 Installs and updates tools to their latest versions with a single command
- 📊 Tracks installed versions and update timestamps for all tools
- 🧩 Extracts binaries from various archive formats (zip, tar.gz)
- 📂 Organizes tools by platform and architecture for easy access
- 🐙 Easy integration with your dotfiles repository for version control
- ⚙️ **Automatic PATH & Shell Code:** Configures `PATH` and applies custom shell snippets (`shell_code`).

## :bulb: Why I Created dotbins

I frequently works across multiple environments where I clone my dotfiles repository with all my preferred configurations.
I faced a common frustration: some of my favorite tools (`fzf`, `bat`, `zoxide`, etc.) were not available on the new system and installing them with a package manager is too much work or even not possible.
`dotbins` was born out of this frustration.

It allows me to:

1. Track pre-compiled binaries in a [separate Git repository](https://github.com/basnijholt/.dotbins) (using Git LFS for efficient storage)
2. Include that repository as a submodule in my dotfiles
3. Ensure all my essential tools are _immediately_ available after cloning, regardless of system permissions

Now when I clone my dotfiles on any new system, I get not just my configurations but also all the CLI tools I depend on for productivity, **ready to use with their specific aliases and shell initializations automatically configured**.

**_No package manager, no sudo, no problem!_**

## :books: Usage

> [!TIP]
> Use `uvx dotbins` and create a `~/.config/dotbins/config.yaml` file to store your configuration.

To use `dotbins`, you'll need to familiarize yourself with its commands:

```bash
dotbins --help
```

<!-- CODE:BASH:START -->
<!-- echo '```bash' -->
<!-- dotbins --help -->
<!-- echo '```' -->

### Commands

1. **sync** - Install and update tools to their latest versions
2. **get** - Download and install a tool directly without using a configuration file
3. **init** - Initialize the tools directory structure
4. **list** - List available tools defined in your configuration
5. **version** - Print version information
6. **status** - Show detailed information about available and installed tool versions

### Quick Install with `dotbins get`

The `get` command allows you to quickly download and install tools directly from GitHub or from a remote configuration file:

```bash
# Install fzf to the default location (~/.local/bin)
dotbins get junegunn/fzf

# Install ripgrep with a custom binary name
dotbins get BurntSushi/ripgrep --name rg

# Install bat to a specific location
dotbins get sharkdp/bat --dest ~/bin

# Install multiple tools from a remote config URL/local path
dotbins get https://example.com/my-tools.yaml --dest ~/.local/bin
```

This is perfect for:

- Quickly installing tools on a new system
- One-off installations without needing a configuration file
- Adding tools to PATH in standard locations like `~/.local/bin`
- Bootstrapping with a pre-configured set of tools using a remote configuration URL or local config

The `get` command automatically detects whether you're providing a GitHub repository or a configuration URL/path.
When using a URL/path, it will download all tools defined in the configuration for your current platform and architecture.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Installation

We highly recommend to use [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to run `dotbins`:

```bash
uvx dotbins
```

or install as a global command:

```bash
uv tool install dotbins
```

Otherwise, simply use pip:

```bash
pip install dotbins
```

You'll also need to create or update your `dotbins.yaml` configuration file either in the same directory as the script or at a custom location specified with `--tools-dir`.

## :gear: Configuration

dotbins uses a YAML configuration file to define the tools and settings. The configuration file is searched in the following locations (in order):

1. Explicitly provided path (using `--config-file` option)
2. `./dotbins.yaml` (current directory)
3. `~/.config/dotbins/config.yaml` (XDG config directory)
4. `~/.config/dotbins.yaml` (XDG config directory, flat)
5. `~/.dotbins.yaml` (home directory)
6. `~/.dotbins/dotbins.yaml` (default dotfiles location)

The first valid configuration file found will be used. If no configuration file is found, default settings will be used.

### Basic Configuration

```yaml
# Basic settings
tools_dir: ~/.dotbins # (optional, ~/.dotbins by default)

# Target platforms and architectures (optional, current system by default)
platforms:
  linux:
    - amd64
    - arm64
  macos:
    - arm64 # Only arm64 for macOS

# Tool definitions
tools:
  # Tool configuration entries
```

### Tool Configuration

Each tool must be configured with at least a GitHub repository.
Many other fields are optional and can be auto-detected.

The simplest configuration is:

```yaml
tools:
  # tool-name: owner/repo
  zoxide: ajeetdsouza/zoxide
  fzf: junegunn/fzf
```

dotbins will auto-detect the latest release, choose the appropriate asset for your platform, and install binaries to the specified `tools_dir` (defaults to `~/.dotbins`).

When auto-detection isn't possible or you want more control, you can provide detailed configuration:

```yaml
tool-name:
  repo: owner/repo                 # Required: GitHub repository
  binary_name: executable-name     # Optional: Name of the resulting binary(ies) (defaults to tool-name)
  extract_archive: true            # Optional: Whether to extract from archive (true) or direct download (false) (auto-detected if not specified)
  path_in_archive: path/to/binary  # Optional: Path to the binary within the archive (auto-detected if not specified)

  # Asset patterns - Optional with auto-detection
  # Option 1: Platform-specific patterns
  asset_patterns:                  # Optional: Asset patterns for each platform
    linux: pattern-for-linux.tar.gz
    macos: pattern-for-macos.tar.gz
  # Option 2: Single pattern for all platforms
  asset_patterns: pattern-for-all-platforms.tar.gz  # Global pattern for all platforms
  # Option 3: Explicit platform patterns for different architectures
  asset_patterns:
    linux:
      amd64: pattern-for-linux-amd64.tar.gz
      arm64: pattern-for-linux-arm64.tar.gz
    macos:
      amd64: pattern-for-macos-amd64.tar.gz
      arm64: pattern-for-macos-arm64.tar.gz
```

### Platform and Architecture Mapping

If the tool uses different naming for platforms or architectures:

```yaml
tool-name:
  # Basic fields...
  platform_map:                    # Optional: Platform name mapping
    macos: darwin                  # Converts "macos" to "darwin" in patterns
  arch_map:                        # Optional: Architecture name mapping
    amd64: x86_64                  # Converts "amd64" to "x86_64" in patterns
    arm64: aarch64                 # Converts "arm64" to "aarch64" in patterns
```

### Pattern Variables

In asset patterns, you can use these variables:

- `{version}` - Release version (without 'v' prefix)
- `{platform}` - Platform name (after applying platform_map)
- `{arch}` - Architecture name (after applying arch_map)

### Multiple Binaries

For tools that provide multiple binaries:

```yaml
tool-name:
  # Other fields...
  binary_name: [main-binary, additional-binary]
  path_in_archive: [path/to/main, path/to/additional]
```

### Configuration Examples

#### Minimal Tool Configuration

```yaml
direnv:
  repo: direnv/direnv
```

or

```yaml
ripgrep:
  repo: BurntSushi/ripgrep
  binary_name: rg # Only specify if different from tool name
```

#### Standard Tool

```yaml
atuin:
  repo: atuinsh/atuin
  arch_map:
    amd64: x86_64
    arm64: aarch64
  asset_patterns:
    linux: atuin-{arch}-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
    macos: atuin-{arch}-apple-darwin.tar.gz
```

#### Tool with Multiple Binaries

```yaml
uv:
  repo: astral-sh/uv
  binary_name: [uv, uvx]
  path_in_archive: [uv-*/uv, uv-*/uvx]
```

#### Platform-Specific Tool

```yaml
eza:
  repo: eza-community/eza
  arch_map:
    amd64: x86_64
    arm64: aarch64
  asset_patterns:
    linux: eza_{arch}-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
    macos: null # No macOS version available
```

#### Shell-Specific Configuration

The auto-generated shell scripts that add the binaries to your PATH will include the tool-specific shell code if provided.

For example, see the following configuration:

```yaml
tools:
  fzf:
    repo: junegunn/fzf
    shell_code: |
      source <(fzf --zsh)

  zoxide:
    repo: ajeetdsouza/zoxide
    shell_code: |
      eval "$(zoxide init zsh)"

  eza:
    repo: eza-community/eza
    shell_code: |
      alias l="eza -lah --git"
```

If you want to make your config compatible with multiple shells (e.g., zsh, bash, fish), you can use the following syntax:

```yaml
starship:
  repo: starship/starship
  shell_code:
    zsh: eval "$(starship init zsh)"
    bash: eval "$(starship init bash)"
    fish: starship init fish | source
```

# :thinking: Comparison with Alternatives

`dotbins` fills a specific niche in the binary management ecosystem. Here's how it compares to key alternatives:

| Tool          | Version Management                 | Shell Integration             | Dotfiles Integration           | Primary Use Case           |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| **dotbins**   | Latest only                        | **Built-in via `shell_code`** | **First-class with Git (LFS)** | Complete dotfiles solution |
| **binenv**    | Multiple versions with constraints | Separate completion scripts   | Not focused on                 | Development environments   |
| **eget**      | Latest or specific only            | None                          | Not focused on                 | Quick one-off installs     |
| **asdf/aqua** | Multiple plugins & versions        | Plugin-specific               | Not focused on                 | Development environments   |
| **apt/brew**  | System packages                    | None                          | Not possible                   | System-wide management     |

## Key Alternatives

### Version Managers (e.g., `binenv`, `asdf`)

- **Pros:** Advanced version management (constraints like `>=1.2.3`), multiple versions side-by-side
- **Cons vs. `dotbins`:**
  - Focus on version management rather than dotfiles integration
  - **Separate configuration needed for shell integration** (aliases, completions)
  - Often use shims or more complex architecture
- **When to choose:** For development environments where you need multiple versions of tools

### Binary Downloaders (e.g., `eget`)

- **Pros:** Lightweight, fast for one-off downloads
- **Cons vs. `dotbins`:**
  - No configuration for multiple tools
  - **No shell integration** for aliases or environment setup
  - No version tracking between sessions
- **When to choose:** For quick installation of individual tools without configuration needs

### System Package Managers (`apt`, `brew`, etc.)

- **Pros:** System-wide installation, dependency management
- **Cons vs. `dotbins`:**
  - Require admin privileges
  - Not portable across systems
  - Cannot be version-controlled in dotfiles
- **When to choose:** For system-wide software needed by multiple users

## The `dotbins` Difference

`dotbins` uniquely combines:

1. **Binary management** - Downloading from GitHub Releases
2. **Shell configuration** - Defining aliases and shell setup in the same file:
   ```yaml
   bat:
     repo: sharkdp/bat
     shell_code: |
       alias cat="bat --plain --paging=never"
   ```
3. **Dotfiles integration** - Designed to be version-controlled as a Git repository
4. **Cross-platform portability** - Works the same across Linux, macOS, Windows

This makes it perfect for users who want to manage their complete shell environment in a version-controlled dotfiles repository that can be easily deployed on any system.
