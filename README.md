## :zap: Quick Start

Using the amazing [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager:

```bash
# Install directly to ~/.local/bin
uvx dotbins get junegunn/fzf

# Set up multiple tools with a config file
uvx dotbins update

# Bootstrap a collection of tools from a remote config
uvx dotbins get https://github.com/basnijholt/.dotbins/blob/main/dotbins.yaml
```

## :star2: Features

* 🌐 Supports multiple platforms (macOS, Linux, etc.) and architectures (amd64, arm64, etc.)
* 📦 Downloads and organizes binaries from GitHub releases
* 🔄 Updates tools to their latest versions with a single command
* 📊 Tracks installed versions and update timestamps for all tools
* 🧩 Extracts binaries from various archive formats (zip, tar.gz)
* 📂 Organizes tools by platform and architecture for easy access
* 🐙 Easy integration with your dotfiles repository for version control

## :bulb: Why I Created dotbins

I frequently works across multiple environments where I clone my dotfiles repository with all my preferred configurations.
I faced a common frustration: some of my favorite tools (`fzf`, `bat`, `zoxide`, etc.) were not available on the new system and installing them with a package manager is too much work or even not possible.
`dotbins` was born out of this frustration.

It allows me to:

1. Track pre-compiled binaries in a [separate Git repository](https://github.com/basnijholt/.dotbins) (using Git LFS for efficient storage)
2. Include this repository as a submodule in my dotfiles
3. Ensure all my essential tools are immediately available after cloning, regardless of system permissions

Now when I clone my dotfiles on any new system, I get not just my configurations but also all the CLI tools I depend on for productivity.

**_No package manager, no sudo, no problem!_**

## :books: Usage

> [!TIP]
> Use `uvx dotbins` and create a `~/.config/dotbins/config.yaml` file to store your configuration.

To use `dotbins`, you'll need to familiarize yourself with its commands:

```bash
dotbins --help
```

<!-- CODE:BASH:START -->
<!-- echo '```bash' -->
<!-- dotbins --help -->
<!-- echo '```' -->
<!-- CODE:END -->

<!-- OUTPUT:START -->
<!-- ⚠️ This content is auto-generated by `markdown-code-runner`. -->
```bash
Usage: dotbins [-h] [-v] [--tools-dir TOOLS_DIR] [--config-file CONFIG_FILE]
               {list,update,init,version,versions,readme,get} ...

dotbins - Manage CLI tool binaries in your dotfiles repository

```

<!-- OUTPUT:END -->

### Commands

1. **update** - Download or update tools
2. **get** - Download and install a tool directly without using a configuration file
3. **init** - Initialize the tools directory structure
4. **list** - List available tools defined in your configuration
5. **version** - Print version information
6. **versions** - Show detailed information about installed tool versions

### Quick Install with `dotbins get`

The `get` command allows you to quickly download and install tools directly from GitHub or from a remote configuration file:

```bash
# Install fzf to the default location (~/.local/bin)
dotbins get junegunn/fzf

# Install ripgrep with a custom binary name
dotbins get BurntSushi/ripgrep --name rg

# Install bat to a specific location
dotbins get sharkdp/bat --dest ~/bin

# Install multiple tools from a remote config URL
dotbins get https://example.com/my-tools.yaml --dest ~/.local/bin
```

This is perfect for:
- Quickly installing tools on a new system
- One-off installations without needing a configuration file
- Adding tools to PATH in standard locations like `~/.local/bin`
- Bootstrapping with a pre-configured set of tools using a remote configuration URL

The `get` command automatically detects whether you're providing a GitHub repository or a configuration URL.
When using a URL, it will download all tools defined in the configuration for your current platform and architecture.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Installation

We highly recommend to use [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to run `dotbins`:

```bash
uvx dotbins
```

or install as a global command:

```bash
uv tool install dotbins
```

Otherwise, simply use pip:

```bash
pip install dotbins
```

You'll also need to create or update your `dotbins.yaml` configuration file either in the same directory as the script or at a custom location specified with `--tools-dir`.

## :gear: Configuration

dotbins uses a YAML configuration file to define the tools and settings. The configuration file is searched in the following locations (in order):

1. Explicitly provided path (using `--config-file` option)
2. `./dotbins.yaml` (current directory)
3. `~/.config/dotbins/config.yaml` (XDG config directory)
4. `~/.config/dotbins.yaml` (XDG config directory, flat)
5. `~/.dotbins.yaml` (home directory)
6. `~/.dotbins/dotbins.yaml` (default dotfiles location)

The first valid configuration file found will be used. If no configuration file is found, default settings will be used.

### Basic Configuration

```yaml
# Basic settings
tools_dir: ~/.dotbins

# Target platforms and architectures
platforms:
  linux:
    - amd64
    - arm64
  macos:
    - arm64  # Only arm64 for macOS

# Tool definitions
tools:
  # Tool configuration entries
```

### Tool Configuration

Each tool must be configured with at least a GitHub repository.
Many other fields are optional and can be auto-detected.

The simplest configuration is:

```yaml
tools:
  # tool-name: owner/repo
  zoxide: ajeetdsouza/zoxide
  fzf: junegunn/fzf
```

This will download and autodetect the latest release from GitHub and install it in to the specified `tools_dir` (defaults to `~/.dotbins`).

When auto-detect is not possible or you want to be more explicit, you can specify the following fields:
```yaml
tool-name:
  repo: owner/repo                 # Required: GitHub repository
  extract_binary: true             # Optional: Whether to extract from archive (true) or direct download (false) (auto-detected if not specified)
  binary_name: executable-name     # Optional: Name of the resulting binary(ies) (defaults to tool-name)
  binary_path: path/to/binary      # Optional: Path to the binary within the archive (auto-detected if not specified)

  # Asset patterns - Optional with auto-detection
  # Option 1: Platform-specific patterns
  asset_patterns:                  # Optional: Asset patterns for each platform
    linux: pattern-for-linux.tar.gz
    macos: pattern-for-macos.tar.gz
  # Option 2: Single pattern for all platforms
  asset_patterns: pattern-for-all-platforms.tar.gz  # Global pattern for all platforms
  # Option 3: Explicit platform patterns for different architectures
  asset_patterns:
    linux:
      amd64: pattern-for-linux-amd64.tar.gz
      arm64: pattern-for-linux-arm64.tar.gz
    macos:
      amd64: pattern-for-macos-amd64.tar.gz
      arm64: pattern-for-macos-arm64.tar.gz
```

If you don't specify `binary_path` or `asset_patterns`, `dotbins` will attempt to auto-detect the appropriate values for you. This often works well for standard tool releases.

### Platform and Architecture Mapping

If the tool uses different naming for platforms or architectures:

```yaml
tool-name:
  # Basic fields...
  platform_map:                    # Optional: Platform name mapping
    macos: darwin                  # Converts "macos" to "darwin" in patterns
  arch_map:                        # Optional: Architecture name mapping
    amd64: x86_64                  # Converts "amd64" to "x86_64" in patterns
    arm64: aarch64                 # Converts "arm64" to "aarch64" in patterns
```

### Pattern Variables

In asset patterns, you can use these variables:
- `{version}` - Release version (without 'v' prefix)
- `{platform}` - Platform name (after applying platform_map)
- `{arch}` - Architecture name (after applying arch_map)

### Multiple Binaries

For tools that provide multiple binaries:

```yaml
tool-name:
  # Other fields...
  binary_name: [main-binary, additional-binary]
  binary_path: [path/to/main, path/to/additional]
```

### Configuration Examples

#### Minimal Tool Configuration

```yaml
direnv:
  repo: direnv/direnv
```
or
```yaml
ripgrep:
  repo: BurntSushi/ripgrep
  binary_name: rg  # Only specify if different from tool name
```

#### Standard Tool

```yaml
atuin:
  repo: atuinsh/atuin
  arch_map:
    amd64: x86_64
    arm64: aarch64
  asset_patterns:
    linux: atuin-{arch}-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
    macos: atuin-{arch}-apple-darwin.tar.gz
```

#### Tool with Multiple Binaries

```yaml
uv:
  repo: astral-sh/uv
  binary_name: [uv, uvx]
  binary_path: [uv-*/uv, uv-*/uvx]
```

#### Platform-Specific Tool

```yaml
eza:
  repo: eza-community/eza
  arch_map:
    amd64: x86_64
    arm64: aarch64
  asset_patterns:
    linux: eza_{arch}-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
    macos: null  # No macOS version available
```
